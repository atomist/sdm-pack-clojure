    SoftwareDeliveryMachineConfiguration,
} from "@atomist/sdm";
import {
    createSoftwareDeliveryMachine,
} from "@atomist/sdm-core";
import { LeinSupport } from "@atomist/sdm-pack-clojure";

export function machine(configuration: SoftwareDeliveryMachineConfiguration): SoftwareDeliveryMachine {
    const sdm = createSoftwareDeliveryMachine({
        name: "My Software Delivery Machine",
        configuration,
    });
    sdm.addExtensionPacks(LeinSupport);
    return sdm;
};
